# Doctor-Appointment-Booking-System-MERN

The project aimed to develop a Doctor Appointment Booking System using the MERN stack
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to streamline the process of booking medical
consultations. The system was designed to connect patients with doctors efficiently, reducing
manual appointment scheduling and improving accessibility.
